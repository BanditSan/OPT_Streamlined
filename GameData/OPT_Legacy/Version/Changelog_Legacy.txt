OPT Legacy Spaceplane Parts

1.4.0 (WIP)

* Minor engine tuning. ARI engines assume they're in vacuum at 0.1% or 0.001 atm.
* Fixed parts having obsolete category "Propulsion" to "FuelTank".
* Fixed drag cubes in Avatar hollow parts. This made the use of Avatar--Stail adapters in payload-bearing planes actual nightmares.
* Fixed drag cubes for Humpback hollow parts.
* Fixed parts having invalid `dragModelType = override` setting. This causes horrific drag effects.
* Changed the internal names of Avatar parts (formerly "Chimera") that had a "C" designation to "A" to be inline with all other Avatar parts. The Chimera instances are soft-deprecated to not break craft files.
* Legacy wings: removed lift surface module (again); raised actuator speed.
* Applied IVAs (either stock placeholder or closely-matching OPT IVA):
  * Avatar Chimera cockpit
  * K Oulette and K TAV cockpit
* Adjusted and normalized heat tolerances. Many in the Avatar and Stail family had > 3000K. Some other parts (mainly some cockpits) had only 1500K.

(Extremely WIP)

* Resurrect Avatar Shuttle/Freight cockpit


1.3.1

* Prune the lurking Firespitter modules from part configs.
* Reduce cooling requirements in Power Spheres and replace degeneration mechanism's converter module with RTG module. The always-on converter, though it should not use core heat, was somehow a magnet for the timewarp heat bug.
* Nerfed tankage in all inline RCS and aerodynamic RCS clusters. They were quite excessive.
* All RCS performance balanced and now use Plume Party "Soyuz" RCS FX.


1.3.0.2

* Restored unused textures. Shame on me.
* Adjusted versioning URLs.


1.3.0.1

* Adusted radiators.


1.3.0

* Added missing "OPT" prefix to Mk3 part titles.
* Added OPT Nebula Shock intake. It features shock cone animations which require B9 Animation Modules plugin found in B9 Aerospace.
* Added OPT power spheres (super fuel cell and fusion reactors). These will also hold and depend on Dark Goo unless you delete the DarkDrive config.
* Fixed ARI-73 non-spool mode in vacuum.
* Adjusted legacy wings CoL and CoM.
* Deleted unused texture folders, reduced download size by 20 MB.


1.2.5

* Reassessed some bulkhead profiles:
  * updated avatar and chimera
* Fixed missing bulkhead profiles
* Added non-spool secondary mode to ARI-73 engine (for vacuum friendly operation)
* Moved Stail lab to unlock alongside the J lab


1.2

* Anti-collision for Modular Fuel Tanks.
* Fixed Avatar and Humpback aero shielding (except when ramps are attached).
* Aero shielding for things clippd far enough into the Avatar-Chimera cockpit adapter.
* Added inner nodes to Stail Docking & Utility Bay. (Aero shielding always active in it.)
* Added joint strength to Humpback parts.

1.1.3

* Moved CoL, CoP and CoM (centers of lift, pressure (drag) and mass) in Legacy wings so they make more sense (or stop making less sense) in aircraft designs. This should fix a good deal more aero problems.

1.1.2

* Added/fixed science container and Crew Report experiment to Humpback cabin and Stail cockpit
* Moved J-60 and J-61 to Aerospace Tech/ Exp Aircraft Engines in tech trees

1.1.1

* Fixed RCS in Legacy K cockpits
* Renamed 2.5m ILS cockpit to fix repeat part name issue and part icon spam in the tech tree
* Fixed bulkhead profile in WarpJet SAGE engine
* Fixed 2.5m ISP cockpit problem (now there's a new/returning part: the ISP Cockpit Legacy)
* Added missing surface attach for Stail Fairing Monopropellant Tank

1.1.0

* Added dependency/migrated most MM patches to --> OPT Reconfig mod
* Added LFO version of aerodynamic OMS blocks
* Added Mk2 ram intake (it will not cause any game or craft issues)
* Fixed 
  * CCK support (OPT category will show if OPT Legacy without OPT Main is installed)
  * Manufacturer in blade antenna and some tanks
  * bulkhead profile in J-81 engine, spotted by Kolago
  * Stail lab science cap, is 1050 now, not 500
* Added Tweakscale for all the surface-attached RCS
* Replaced FS dependency in Stail docking and utility bay with stock module
* Configured engines:
  * Retuned WarpJets and fixed Isp problem. SAGE is a little stronger now and will flameout at 9 atm, not 3 atm
  * Adjusted particles for all engines (again =D )
  * Use cases
    * J-61 is no longer as wasteful or wildly OP but is a dynamic scramjet now (endless acceleration with Isp falloff)
    * J-60 is also a dynamic scramjet (endless acceleration with Isp falloff)
    * J-60D requires EC in ClosedCycle, Isp lowered so the J-81 stands alone as highest Isp vac engine (like Dark Drive) but J-60D in closed cycle remains very powerful near sea-level in atmo unlike J-81
    * J-81 requires EC in ClosedCycle and is poor near sea level, gets a boost at 0.3 atm pressure
	* J-81 airbreathing mode adjusted for thick atmosphere
    * Stail Linear Aerospike has better thrust and Isp
  * Gimbals
    * J-81 visibly animates: given plenty Yaw authority and slight Pitch authority due to dual nozzle (emulate differential thrust)
    * J-60 and J-60D same as J-81 but do not animate
    * WarpJet SURGE given half gimbal ranges of J-60, J-60D
    * Stail Linear Aerospike does not animate but is given plenty Pitch authority

1.0.9

* Added inner attachment nodes for Humpback hollow fuselage
* Adjustment to ARI-73 and WarpJet engines (In particular, the ARI no longer grants insane dV)
* Fixed Tweakscale and RemoteTech patches
* Fixed cargo bay modules, removed aeroshield patch: the problem of reversed cargo module status
* Further bulk update to all cargo bays and hollow fuselages: add/fix attach nodes, cargo modules, categories
* Avatar parts:
	* Added/fixed fuel switch for hollow fuselage and cargo bay
	* Updated cockpit RCS

* Added improved particles to SAGE, SURGE, ARI-73, J60D, J-81 engines 
* Added Tweakscale to SAGE, SURGE, ARI-73, J60D engines
