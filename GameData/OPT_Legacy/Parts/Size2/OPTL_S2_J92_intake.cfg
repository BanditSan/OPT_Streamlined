    description = Designing an air-breathing engine tends to be easy. Designing the ultimate among them was rather hard... But designing the nacelle fit for that engine, the J-92 "Nebula" Shcramjet, had OPT's brightest minds simply beat their heads against their desks. This was until someone discovered a way to compartmentalize the internals properly...after randomly cramming things into their drawer and later finding that everything somehow sorted themselves nicely.
