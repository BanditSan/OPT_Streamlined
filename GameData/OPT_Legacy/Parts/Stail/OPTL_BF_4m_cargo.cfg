	description = While maintaining the aerodynamics of 'Stail' parts, the 'Stail' Freight modules allow large sized cargo to be loaded at the expense of any fuel capacity. Despite rumors, we have it from a reliable source within OPT, that the Stail Freight parts are *not* actually just reconditioned shipping crates that new Stail class parts themselves, are delivered in from the manufacturer.
