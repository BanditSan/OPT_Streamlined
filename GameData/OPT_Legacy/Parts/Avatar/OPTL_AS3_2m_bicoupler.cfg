	description = Capable of providing not one, but two 3.75m attachment points, the Avatar bicoupler was heralded as a revolution in the aerospace industry. While by and large it failed to live up to these expectations, it did manage to revolutionize the emerging field of splitting one big thing into two big things -- something at which it excels.
