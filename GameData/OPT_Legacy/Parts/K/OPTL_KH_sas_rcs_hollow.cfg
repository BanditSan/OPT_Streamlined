    description =  Some engineers even with OPT had wanted for a long time for this very part to come to market. Unfortunately, right after they decided to start assembling a concept part for themselves, the aerodynamic thruster blocks began rolling off the assembly lines. These engineers decided to compromise and they submitted their project as basically a Utility part carrying only the tank and torque wheels. Their rebellion was fortnately not enough to get them sacked or worse.
