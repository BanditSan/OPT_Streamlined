NO LOG - NO HELP


1) Holy crap these parts are awesome but they have no fuel?!
	A) You do not have B9 Part Switch or Wild Blue Industries mods installed.
	B) You do not have OPT Reconfig installed. Get it here: https://spacedock.info/mod/1808/OPT%20Reconfig
	
2) KSP hangs during startup when this mod is installed.
	A) Some engines require a non-stock resource. Please install Community Resource Pack.
	
3) You don't use Firespitter anymore?
	A) Firespitter is an old, messy mod and requires too much effort to add tank options for. B9 Part Switch is a very small mod; very popular; and very easy to add tank options with.
	
4) Can you add 'X new part'?
	A) feel free to make requests but no one is available who is interested in making all-new parts. Sorry.
	B) Some parts like an H cockpit are or were meant not to be made.
